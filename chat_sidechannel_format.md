## Character announcement

Clients will announce `# Appears as CHARACTER` when changing their character, joining a comic channel, or switching to comic mode for the first time on a channel. After announcing it, Comic Chat clients seeing this message will supress it and then proceed to PRIVMSG the user who sent it their `# Appears as` block.
